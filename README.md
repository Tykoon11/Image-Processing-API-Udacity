This is an Image Processing API It allows for cropping of images, by defining the filename, width and heigh from the URL

In the project directory, you can run:

// npm run start
Runs the app. Open http://localhost:3001/api/images?filename=icelandwaterfall&width=900&height=900 to view in the browser and edit specifications. The page will reload if you make edits to the filename, height, and width, of the URL

The assets folder contains the images and the filenames. The width and height set in the URL above will determine the size of the image to be rendered in the browser (ie. It can be cropped)

// npm run prettier
Prettier is the preferred for code formatting in this project

// npm run test
